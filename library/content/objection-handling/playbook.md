## The Five Objection Categories

Every objection falls into one of these categories:

| Category | Objection | Real Concern |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Budget** | "It's too expensive" | Not seeing value or ROI |
| **Authority** | "I need to check with my boss" | Risk of making wrong decision |
| **Need** | "We don't really need this" | Don't understand the problem |
| **Timing** | "Not right now" | Other priorities or uncertainty |
| **Competition** | "We're using X already" | Switching cost concern |

## Objection Handling Frameworks

### LAER Framework

> "Jack Carew coined LAER in his 1990 book entitled 'You'll Never Get No for an Answer.'"
>
> *Source: [Carew International](https://www.carew.com/laer-bonding-process-timeless-essential-effective-selling/)*

| Step | Action | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **L**isten | Fully hear the concern without interrupting | Let them speak completely |
| **A**cknowledge | Show you understand without agreeing or arguing | "I understand why you'd feel that way" |
| **E**xplore | Ask questions to uncover the real objection | "Can you tell me more about that?" |
| **R**espond | Address the true concern with value/solution | Provide relevant response |

**Example in action:**

```
Prospect: "Your price is too high."

Listen:    [Stay silent, let them elaborate]
Acknowledge: "I understand budget is a real concern."
Explore:   "Help me understand—is it outside your budget,
            or are you not sure it's worth the investment?"
Respond:   [Based on their answer, address the real issue]
```

### LAARC Framework

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **L**isten | Hear the full objection |
| **A**cknowledge | Validate their concern |
| **A**ssess | Determine the real issue |
| **R**espond | Provide targeted response |
| **C**onfirm | Verify objection is resolved |

> "The Confirm step ensures you've actually addressed the concern, not just talked past it."
>

### The 4 P's Framework

| Step | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **P**roblem | Identify their specific challenge |
| **P**ain | Quantify the cost of not solving it |
| **P**roof | Show evidence of your solution working |
| **P**roduct | Connect your offering to their needs |

## Price Objection Responses

> "Price objections aren't rejections—they're opportunities to align on value."
>
> *Source: [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/price-objection-responses)*

### Never Do This

- ❌ Immediately offer a discount
- ❌ Get defensive about pricing
- ❌ Agree that you're expensive
- ❌ Launch into feature dump

> "According to sales expert Geoffrey James, a price objection isn't 'real' until the customer has brought it up twice."
>
> *Source: [Close](https://blog.close.com/what-is-usually-hidden-behind-the-price-objection-in-sales/)*

### Effective Responses

**1. Clarify the objection**
```
"When you say 'too expensive,' do you mean it's outside your
budget, or that you're not sure if it's worth the investment?"
```

**2. Reframe with ROI**
```
"I know $5,000 sounds like a lot upfront. But when you break
it down, that's about $13 a day—less than what most teams
spend on coffee."
```

**3. Quantify the value**
```
"Our customers typically save 10 hours a week. What's that
worth to you in real dollars?"
```

**4. Compare to cost of inaction**
```
"What's it costing you right now NOT to have this solved?
How many leads are you losing per month?"
```

**5. The silence technique**
```
[Customer says price is too high]
[You stay silent for 3-5 seconds]
[Customer often elaborates on the real concern]
```

**6. Break down the cost**
```
"It's $1,200/year. That works out to $100/month, or about
$3.30/day—less than a coffee."
```

### Price Objection Decision Tree

```
"It's too expensive"
        │
        ▼
  Ask: "Compared to what?"
        │
        ├── "Our budget"
        │       └── Explore payment options, ROI timeline
        │
        ├── "Competitor X"
        │       └── Differentiate value, total cost of ownership
        │
        ├── "The value"
        │       └── Reframe ROI, share case studies
        │
        └── "What we expected"
                └── Understand their research, adjust positioning
```

## Website Objection Handling

### Strategic Placement

> "Don't confine objection handling to one section; address concerns throughout your content, preferably at the point the objection is likely to occur."
>
> *Source: [Boagworld](https://boagworld.com/marketing/objection-handling/)*

| Page Location | Likely Objection | How to Address |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| Pricing page | "Too expensive" | ROI calculator, savings comparison |
| Features page | "Too complex" | "Get started in 5 minutes" |
| Homepage | "Not for me" | Audience segmentation |
| Checkout | "Not sure yet" | Money-back guarantee |
| Any CTA | "Not right now" | Lead magnet alternative |

### FAQ as Objection Buster

> "FAQs are the great objection busters—you basically list out the 'questions' (which are objections in disguise) and then overcome them all in one area."
>
> *Source: [Pagecloud](https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/best-practices-for-faqs)*

**Questions are objections in disguise:**

| Question | Hidden Objection |
|----------|------------------|
| "Is this right for me?" | "I'm not sure this is right for me" |
| "How long does it take?" | "This seems like a lot of work" |
| "What if I don't like it?" | "I'm worried I'll waste money" |
| "Do you offer support?" | "I'm worried I'll get stuck" |
| "Is my data secure?" | "I don't trust you with my info" |

## Objection Response Templates

### Budget Objections

**"It's outside our budget"**
```
"I understand budget is a real constraint. Two questions: First,
what is your budget for solving [problem]? And second, what's the
cost to your business of NOT solving it this quarter?"
```

**"We're spending elsewhere right now"**
```
"That makes sense. What are you currently investing in? I ask
because many of our customers found they could reallocate from
[related area] because our solution addresses both needs."
```

**"Can you give us a discount?"**
```
"I appreciate you being direct. Before we discuss pricing, help
me understand—is price the only thing standing between us and
moving forward?"
```

### Authority Objections

**"I need to check with my boss"**
```
"Absolutely. What questions do you think they'll have? I'd love
to help you present this in the best way possible."
```

**"This isn't my decision"**
```
"Understood. Would it be helpful if I joined a call with the
decision-maker? I can address their specific concerns directly."
```

### Need Objections

**"We don't really need this"**
```
"I hear you. Can I ask—how are you currently handling [problem]?
What's that process costing you in time and resources?"
```

**"We're doing fine without it"**
```
"That's great to hear. Out of curiosity, what would 'better than
fine' look like for you? What would you improve if you could?"
```

### Timing Objections

**"Now isn't a good time"**
```
"I understand. Is there a specific reason the timing is off, or
is there something I could do to make this more convenient?"
```

**"We're too busy right now"**
```
"I totally get that. That's actually why many customers chose us—
they were drowning in [problem] and needed something that saves
time, not adds to their workload."
```

**"Let's revisit next quarter"**
```
"Sure, we can do that. Quick question though—what would need to
change between now and then for this to become a priority?"
```

### Competition Objections

**"We're already using [competitor]"**
```
"Great, [competitor] is solid. What made you choose them
originally? And how is that working out for you?"
```

**"We just signed a contract with X"**
```
"I understand. How long is your contract? Many customers
start evaluating options 3-6 months before renewal so they
have time to make an informed decision."
```
