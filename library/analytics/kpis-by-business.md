## The Metrics Framework

### Leading vs Lagging Indicators

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Leading** | Predict future outcomes | Demo requests, email signups |
| **Lagging** | Measure past outcomes | Revenue, churn |

**Balance both**: Leading indicators help you act before lagging indicators change.

### AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics)

> "The AARRR framework helps startups focus on the metrics that matter at each stage."

> *— Dave McClure*

```
Acquisition → How do users find you?
Activation → Do users have a great first experience?
Retention → Do users come back?
Revenue → How do you make money?
Referral → Do users tell others?
```
