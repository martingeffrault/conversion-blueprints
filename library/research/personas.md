## What is a Buyer Persona?

A buyer persona is a research-based profile of a real decision-maker or influencer in your sales process. It describes their job, motivations, needs, goals, and challenges to help teams understand and target the right people.

> "A B2B buyer persona is a research-based profile of a real decision-maker or influencer in your sales process. Thanks to a detailed description of their job title, motivations, needs, goals, and challenges, sales teams can better understand decision-makers and influencers in the companies they're targeting."

## The Three-Persona Framework (B2B)

For most B2B companies, three personas are sufficient. More leads to complexity without added value.

> "For any campaign—whether it's Account-Based Marketing (ABM), Inbound Marketing, Content Marketing, or even a Product Launch—you only need three buyer personas to have success. More personas just lead to confusion, complexity, and unnecessary extra work."

### The Three Core Personas

| Persona | Role | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| **P1: The User** | Day-to-day operator | Practical value, ease of use, time savings |
| **P2: The Sponsor/Champion** | Internal seller, budget holder | ROI, risk reduction, competitive advantage |
| **P3: The Executive** | Final sign-off | Strategic fit, vendor credibility, long-term value |

### Persona 1: The User

The primary beneficiary who will interact with your solution daily.

**What they care about**:
- Does this actually work?
- Will this make my job easier?
- How steep is the learning curve?
- Will this integrate with my existing tools?

**Content they consume**:
- Product demos
- Feature comparisons
- How-to guides
- User reviews

### Persona 2: The Sponsor/Champion

The person who needs to convince the organization to buy.

**What they care about**:
- Can I justify this purchase?
- What's the ROI?
- How do I get buy-in from others?
- What are the risks?

**Content they consume**:
- Case studies
- ROI calculators
- Competitive analysis
- Implementation guides

### Persona 3: The Executive

Has fiduciary responsibility and gives final approval.

**What they care about**:
- Does this align with our strategy?
- Is this vendor credible?
- What's the total cost of ownership?
- What do my peers think?

**Content they consume**:
- Executive summaries
- Analyst reports
- Peer recommendations
- Strategic whitepapers

## Persona Components

### Essential Elements

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | Fictional but realistic | "Marketing Mary" |
| **Job Title** | Specific role | "VP of Marketing, B2B SaaS" |
| **Company Profile** | Size, industry, stage | "50-200 employees, Series B" |
| **Goals** | What success looks like | "Increase MQLs by 50%" |
| **Challenges** | Current pain points | "Can't attribute revenue to campaigns" |
| **Objections** | Reasons NOT to buy | "We don't have time to implement" |
| **Decision Criteria** | How they evaluate | "Integration, price, support" |
| **Information Sources** | Where they research | "G2, LinkedIn, peer referrals" |

### Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Addition

Beyond demographics, capture the "job" they're hiring your product to do.

> "The Jobs to Be Done framework focuses on contextual motivations and aims to identify the causal driver behind a particular purchase. To determine a 'job to be done,' you must understand what problems the customer is trying to solve within particular circumstances."
>
> *Source: [Advance B2B](https://www.advanceb2b.com/blog/customer-research-guide-b2b-saas)*

**JTBD Statement Format**:
```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
```

**Example**:
```
When I'm preparing board reports, I want to quickly pull campaign
performance data, so I can demonstrate marketing's impact on revenue.
```

## Research Methods for Personas

### 1. Customer Interviews (Primary)

The gold standard for persona development.

**Who to interview**:
- Current customers (best fit)
- Churned customers (objections)
- Lost deals (competitive insights)
- Prospects (early-stage thinking)

**Sample size**: 8-15 interviews per persona

See [interviews.md](interviews.md) for methodology.

### 2. Sales Team Input

Your sales team talks to customers daily.

**Questions for sales**:
- What questions do prospects always ask?
- What objections come up most?
- What makes someone a "good fit"?
- What triggers someone to start looking?

### 3. Support Ticket Analysis

Reveals pain points and language.

**What to look for**:
- Common questions
- Frustrations
- Feature requests
- Use case patterns

### 4. Review Mining

Unsolicited feedback is often more honest.

**Sources**:
- G2, Capterra, TrustRadius
- Amazon reviews (for adjacent products)
- Reddit, forums
- Social media comments

### 5. Analytics Data

Behavioral data validates qualitative findings.

**What to analyze**:
- Traffic sources by conversion
- Content engagement by segment
- Feature usage patterns
- Drop-off points in funnel

## Persona Development Process

### Step 1: Define Hypotheses

Before research, document your assumptions:

```
Hypothesis: Our primary buyer is a marketing manager who...
- Reports to VP of Marketing
- Manages 3-5 campaigns simultaneously
- Struggles with attribution
- Researches on LinkedIn and G2
```

### Step 2: Conduct Research

Mix of methods:
- 10-15 customer interviews
- Sales team workshop
- 100+ review mining data points
- Analytics segmentation

### Step 3: Identify Patterns

Look for clustering around:
- Similar challenges
- Similar goals
- Similar evaluation criteria
- Similar objections

> "Pain points are particularly useful for segmentation in B2B markets. You might identify a common thread that many respondents struggle with, which could be the foundation for a persona."
>

### Step 4: Create Persona Documents

One page per persona with actionable insights.

### Step 5: Validate and Iterate

Test personas against new data. Update quarterly.

## ICP vs. Buyer Persona

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**: Describes the *company* that's a good fit.
**Buyer Persona**: Describes the *person* within that company.

> "Ideal customer profiles are better suited for B2B companies, while buyer personas can be developed for both B2B and B2C companies. In B2B, several people have to approve the purchase."
>
> *Source: [Close](https://www.close.com/blog/b2b-buyer-persona)*

### ICP Components

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Industry | B2B SaaS |
| Company size | 50-500 employees |
| Revenue | $5M-$50M ARR |
| Growth stage | Series A-C |
| Technology stack | Uses Salesforce, HubSpot |
| Pain indicator | Recently hired VP of Marketing |

### How They Work Together

```
ICP → Identifies target companies
     ↓
Personas → Identifies people within those companies
     ↓
Journey Map → Understands how those people buy
```

> ✅ "Needs to prove marketing ROI to justify budget"

### 3. Made-Up Data
> ❌ Assumptions without research
> ✅ Validated through interviews and data

### 4. Static Documents
> ❌ Created once, never updated
> ✅ Reviewed quarterly, updated with new insights

### 5. Unused Personas
