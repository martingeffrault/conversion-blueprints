## VoC Research Methods

### Method Overview

| Method | Type | Best For | Effort |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Surveys (NPS, CES) | Quantitative | Benchmarking | Low |
| Customer interviews | Qualitative | Deep insights | High |
| Review mining | Passive | Unfiltered feedback | Medium |
| Support ticket analysis | Passive | Pain points | Medium |
| Social listening | Passive | Sentiment trends | Low |
| Session recordings | Behavioral | UX issues | Medium |
| Focus groups | Qualitative | Concept testing | High |

### Categorizing Feedback Sources

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Active (Solicited)** | You ask for feedback | Surveys, interviews, feedback forms |
| **Passive (Unsolicited)** | Customers volunteer | Reviews, social media, support tickets |
| **Behavioral** | Actions speak | Session recordings, heatmaps, analytics |

---

## Quantitative Methods

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

**The Question**: "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend or colleague?" (0-10)

| Score | Category | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 9-10 | Promoters | Loyal enthusiasts |
| 7-8 | Passives | Satisfied but vulnerable |
| 0-6 | Detractors | Unhappy customers |

**Calculation**: `NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors`

| NPS Range | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 70+ | World-class |
| 50-69 | Excellent |
| 30-49 | Good |
| 0-29 | Needs improvement |
| Negative | Critical issues |

**When to Send**: After major milestones (purchase, onboarding completion, support resolution)

### Customer Effort Score (CES)

**The Question**: "How easy was it to [complete task]?" (1-7 scale)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 6-7 | Very easy |
| 4-5 | Moderate effort |
| 1-3 | High effort (friction) |

> "Use CES surveys to identify friction points in processes, such as billing or product setup, and prioritize simplifying those experiences."
>
> *Source: [CustomerGauge](https://customergauge.com/voice-of-customer)*

**When to Send**: After specific tasks (checkout, support contact, onboarding step)

### Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

**The Question**: "How satisfied are you with [experience]?" (1-5 stars or scale)

| Use Case | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| Post-purchase | Order confirmation |
| Post-support | Ticket resolution |
| Product feedback | Feature usage |
| General | Periodic check-in |

### Survey Design Best Practices

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Keep it short** | 3-5 questions max for transactional |
| **Be specific** | One topic per survey |
| **Time it right** | Send when experience is fresh |
| **Mobile-first** | 60%+ responses on mobile |
| **Follow up** | Always close the loop |

> "Careful design of surveys and questionnaires is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable data. Questions should be clear, unbiased, and relevant to research objectives."

## The VoC Analysis Framework

### Measure → Act → Loop

> "Account Experience works through three main steps: Measure—listen to customers using NPS and other metrics. In response to insights, close the loop by reaching out to show how you'll improve."

```
┌─────────────┐
│   MEASURE   │ ← Collect feedback (surveys, reviews, interviews)
└──────┬──────┘

└──────┬──────┘

       └──────────► (Repeat)
```

### Common VoC Pitfalls

> "Even mature VoC programs stumble if they ignore three recurring hurdles: collecting thousands of comments then freezing (insight never makes it to action); a few loud voices dominating while quiet customers are ignored; and human filters and cherry-picked quotes warping what's actually true."
>
> *Source: [Thematic](https://getthematic.com/insights/voice-of-customer-research)*

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Analysis paralysis** | Set action deadlines |
| **Loud minority bias** | Quantify all feedback |
| **Cherry-picking** | Use systematic analysis |
| **No action taken** | Assign ownership |
| **No feedback loop** | Always communicate changes |

## VoC for CRO

### Mapping VoC to Conversion Points

| Journey Stage | VoC Method | Questions to Answer |
|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Awareness** | Social listening, reviews | How do people describe their problem? |
| **Consideration** | Interviews, surveys | What alternatives are considered? |
| **Decision** | Exit surveys, interviews | What almost stopped them? |
| **Purchase** | CES, post-purchase survey | Where was friction? |
| **Onboarding** | CES, support analysis | What's confusing? |
| **Retention** | NPS, churn interviews | Why do people leave? |

### Converting Feedback to Tests

| Customer Feedback | CRO Hypothesis |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "Pricing was confusing" | Simplifying pricing page will increase conversions |
| "Wasn't sure if it fit my use case" | Adding use case examples will reduce bounce |
| "Almost left because no free trial" | Adding free trial will increase signups |
| "Didn't trust the site" | Adding trust badges will increase CVR |
| "Too many form fields" | Reducing fields will increase completions |

### VoC-Driven Test Prioritization

| Feedback Source | Volume | Severity | Test Priority |
|-----------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Checkout confusion | High | High | P1 - Immediate |
| Missing feature info | Medium | Medium | P2 - Next sprint |
| Design complaints | Low | Low | P3 - Backlog |
| Mobile issues | High | High | P1 - Immediate |
