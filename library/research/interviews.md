## Why Customer Interviews?

Interviews reveal what analytics and surveys cannot: the *why* behind behavior.

> "User interviews are more complex and important than most optimizers realize. Customer interviews can help you with the design of A/B tests and experiments, sites and landing pages, and actual products."
>
> *Source: [CXL](https://cxl.com/blog/user-interviews/)*

### What Interviews Reveal

| Insight Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Motivations** | Why they started looking for a solution |
| **Objections** | Concerns that almost stopped them |
| **Language** | Exact words they use to describe problems |
| **Triggers** | What event pushed them to act |
| **Alternatives** | What else they considered |
| **Decision criteria** | How they evaluated options |

---

## Interview Frameworks

### Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework

The most powerful framework for understanding purchase decisions.

> "JTBD interviewers don't start an interview with questions about the product but instead ask to hear about the journey behind the purchase. They'll often ask the interviewee to imagine themselves as a subject in a documentary—to give the full, vivid story."
>
> *Source: [CXL](https://cxl.com/blog/customer-interviews/)*

**Core concept**: People "hire" products to make progress in their lives. Understand the job, not just the product.

**JTBD interview flow**:
1. Set the stage (the trigger)
2. Explore the struggle (passive looking)
3. Understand active search (event that pushed action)
4. Map the decision (how they chose)
5. Capture the outcome (results and satisfaction)

### The 5 Whys Framework

For digging deeper into surface-level answers.

> "If your users are eager to present you with a long list of feature requests, don't stop after their first answer, and then keep on asking why. Each time you ask why you get one step closer to the heart of the issue."
>
> *Source: [MentorCruise](https://mentorcruise.com/blog/the-user-interview-framework-5-questions-that-reveal-what-customers-actually-want/)*

**Example**:
```
Q: "Why did you choose our product?"
A: "It had the features we needed."

Q: "Why were those features important?"
A: "We needed to automate reporting."

Q: "Why was automating reporting a priority?"
A: "Our team was spending 20 hours a week on it."

Q: "Why was that a problem?"
A: "We couldn't focus on strategic work."

Q: "Why does strategic work matter now?"
A: "Our CEO is pushing for growth, and we can't scale with manual processes."
```

→ The real insight: Growth pressure from leadership is the trigger.

## Interview Best Practices

### Do's

**1. Focus on past behaviors**
> "Tell me about the last time you..." > "What would you do if..."

**2. Ask open-ended questions**
> "How did you handle that?" > "Did you find that frustrating?"

**3. Use silence**
Let pauses happen. People often fill silence with deeper insights.

**4. Ask for specifics**
> "Can you give me an example?" "What do you mean by 'difficult'?"

**5. Capture exact language**
Write down their exact words. This is gold for copywriting.

### Don'ts

**1. Don't lead the witness**
> ❌ "Wouldn't it be better if..."
> ❌ "Don't you think that..."
> ✅ "How do you feel about..."

**2. Don't pitch your product**
The interview is about them, not you.

**3. Don't accept surface answers**
Dig deeper with "Why?" and "Tell me more."

**4. Don't ask about future behavior**
> ❌ "Would you use this feature?"
> ✅ "Tell me about a time when you needed something like this."

**5. Don't take one interview as gospel**
> "Don't take the results of your customer interview study for gospel. Validate your findings through triangulation."

## Sample Size & Cadence

### Minimum Sample Sizes

| Research Goal | Minimum Interviews |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Exploratory research | 5-8 |
| Persona validation | 8-12 per persona |
| Reliable patterns | 15-20 per persona |
| Comprehensive research | 25+ |

> "You need to talk to at least 15-20 people per user persona before patterns become reliable. When expanding research to include 25+ people, completely different priorities may emerge from what initial small samples suggested."
>
> *Source: [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doing-kickass-customer-interviews)*

### Ongoing Cadence

> "Teams who talk to just one customer every week build a continuous flow of insights that naturally inform their decision-making."
>
> *Source: [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doing-kickass-customer-interviews)*

**Recommended**: 1-2 interviews per week as ongoing practice.

## Analyzing Interview Data

### 1. Transcribe Everything

Use transcription tools (Otter.ai, Rev, Descript) to capture exact language.

### 2. Code Themes

Tag recurring patterns:
- Similar problems
- Similar triggers
- Similar objections
- Similar language

### 3. Create Affinity Maps

Group related insights visually:
- Cluster quotes by theme
- Identify patterns across interviews
- Note outliers and exceptions

### 4. Extract Actionable Insights

| Theme | Frequency | Implication |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| "We spend 20+ hrs on reporting" | 12/15 interviews | Lead with time savings in messaging |
| "Security was a concern" | 8/15 interviews | Add security trust badges |
| "We asked our network first" | 10/15 interviews | Invest in referral program |

### 5. Create Artifacts

- Updated personas
- Customer journey map
- Voice of customer document
- Objection handling guide

## Interview Recruitment

### Who to Interview

| Segment | Value | Questions Answered |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| **Best customers** | What success looks like | Why they love you |
| **Recent customers** | Fresh memory | Decision process |
| **Churned customers** | What went wrong | Objections, gaps |
| **Lost deals** | Competitive insights | Why they chose others |
| **Prospects** | Early-stage thinking | What they're looking for |

### Recruitment Methods

1. **Email current customers** — Highest response rate
2. **Post-purchase survey** — "Would you be open to a 30-min call?"
3. **In-app prompt** — For product research
4. **UserInterviews.com / Respondent.io** — Paid recruitment
5. **LinkedIn outreach** — For prospects/lost deals

### Incentives

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Asking Leading Questions
> ❌ "Don't you find our reporting frustrating?"
> ✅ "How do you feel about the current reporting process?"

### 2. Talking More Than Listening
The customer should talk 80%+ of the time.

### 3. Accepting "I Would" Answers
> ❌ "I would definitely use that feature"
> ✅ "Tell me about a time you needed something like that"

### 4. Small Sample Size
5 interviews ≠ reliable patterns.

### 5. Not Recording
You'll forget details. Always record (with permission).

### 6. Not Acting on Findings
Research without action is waste.
