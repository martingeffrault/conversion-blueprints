## What is a Buyer Journey Map?

A buyer journey map visualizes the path customers take from first becoming aware of a problem to making a purchase decision and beyond. It captures what they do, think, and feel at each stage.

## Touchpoint Mapping

### Touchpoint Categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Digital owned** | Website, blog, email, app |
| **Digital paid** | Ads, sponsored content |
| **Digital earned** | Reviews, mentions, shares |
| **Human** | Sales calls, demos, support |
| **Physical** | Events, direct mail |
| **Partner** | Referrals, co-marketing |

### Touchpoint Optimization

> "Looking at behavioral data (e.g. 'What percentage of our prospects convert to buyers after they've interacted with a specific touchpoint?') will add deeper understanding to the journey map."
>
> *Source: [Mouseflow](https://mouseflow.com/blog/how-to-improve-the-b2b-customer-journey/)*

For each touchpoint, measure:
- **Volume**: How many interact here?
- **Conversion**: What % move to next stage?
- **Satisfaction**: What's the experience like?
- **Impact**: Does this touchpoint correlate with conversion?

- What touchpoints are missing?

### Step 5: Define Ideal State

What should the journey look like?

### Step 6: Prioritize Improvements

- Quick wins (low effort, high impact)
- Strategic investments (high effort, high impact)
- Nice-to-haves (low effort, low impact)

### Step 7: Implement and Iterate

## Using Journey Maps

### For Website Design

Map content and CTAs to journey stages:
- Homepage → All stages (routing)
- Blog → Awareness
- Product pages → Consideration
- Case studies → Decision
- Pricing → Decision

### For Content Strategy

Fill gaps in the journey:
- Missing consideration content? Create comparisons
- Decision friction? Build ROI calculator
- Onboarding drop-off? Create quick-start guides

### For Sales Enablement

- What content does sales need at each stage?
- What questions does each stage trigger?
- What objections arise when?

### For Marketing Automation

Build email sequences that match journey progression:
- Awareness → Educational content
- Consideration → Solution content
- Decision → Case studies + demo invite

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Inside-Out Mapping
> ❌ Mapping your sales process
> ✅ Mapping the customer's experience

### 2. One-Time Project
> ❌ Create once, file away
> ✅ Living document, updated quarterly

### 3. Too Linear
Real journeys loop back, skip stages, and don't follow neat paths.

### 4. Ignoring Emotions
The feelings matter as much as the actions.

### 5. No Data Validation
> ❌ Assumptions only
> ✅ Validated with interviews and analytics
