## Why Research Matters

Without research, you're guessing. With research, you're informed.

> "The companies that get the most value from journey mapping treat it as an ongoing practice rather than a one-time project."

## Key Principles

### 1. Focus on Behaviors, Not Opinions

> "Better customer interview questions focus on past behaviors, not future aspirations."
>
> *Source: [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doing-kickass-customer-interviews)*

- ❌ "Would you use this feature?"
- ✅ "Tell me about the last time you tried to solve this problem."

### 2. Triangulate Findings

Don't rely on one source. Validate across multiple methods:
- Interview says X → Check analytics for X behavior
- Survey shows Y preference → Test Y in A/B experiment

### 3. Research is Ongoing

> "Teams who talk to just one customer every week build a continuous flow of insights that naturally inform their decision-making."
>
> *Source: [User Interviews](https://www.userinterviews.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-doing-kickass-customer-interviews)*

Build research into your regular cadence, not just projects.

### 4. Jobs To Be Done > Demographics

> "The biggest problem with traditional B2B buyer personas is that they don't help you make informed marketing decisions. The Jobs to Be Done framework focuses on contextual motivations and aims to identify the causal driver behind a particular purchase."
>
