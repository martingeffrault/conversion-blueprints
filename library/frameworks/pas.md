# PAS: Problem-Agitate-Solution

> **Best for**: B2B, SaaS, services, problem-aware audiences
> **Complexity**: Low
> **Emotional depth**: High

---

## Overview

PAS is a structured copywriting formula that taps into human emotions by acknowledging a problem, intensifying the feelings around it, and then offering relief through a solution.

> "The magic of PAS lies in its ability to tap into human emotions. By acknowledging a problem, agitating the emotions surrounding it, and then offering a solution, you lead your audience on a journey from pain to relief."

## The Three Components

### 1. Problem
**Goal**: Identify a problem your audience experiences and present it clearly.

- State the problem in your audience's own words
- Be specific — vague problems don't resonate
- Focus on ONE problem (don't combine multiple)

**Example**:
> "Your SaaS website is stopping you from doubling your MRR."

### 2. Agitate
**Goal**: Intensify the problem so it feels more urgent than it seemed.

- Describe negative feelings and consequences
- Use authentic language (don't overdramatize)
- Focus on real consequences they already experience
- Think of yourself as a doctor pointing out symptoms

**Example**:
> "Every day your messaging stays unclear, qualified leads bounce. Your competitors with simpler sites are closing deals you should be winning. That 'we'll fix the website later' keeps getting pushed while revenue stagnates."

### 3. Solution
**Goal**: Present your solution as the clear path to relief.

- Connect directly to the agitated problem
- Be specific about what you offer
- Include concrete outcomes when possible

**Example**:
> "Our messaging framework has helped 200+ SaaS companies clarify their value prop in 2 weeks. Average result: 34% more demo requests."

## Why It Works (Psychology)

PAS aligns with the decision-making process:

1. **Problem recognition** — People don't seek solutions until they acknowledge a problem
2. **Pain amplification** — Emotional investment increases motivation to act
3. **Relief seeking** — Humans naturally move away from pain toward relief

> "Awareness of pain precedes search for relief — a consistent psychological driver."

## Section-by-Section Application

### Hero Section
```
[Problem as headline]
[Agitation in subheadline]
[Solution teased in CTA]
```

**Example**:
- **H1**: "Tired of leads ghosting after the first call?"
- **Subhead**: "You're not alone. 73% of B2B sales cycles stall because prospects don't see the value fast enough."
- **CTA**: "See how top closers fix this →"

### Full Page Structure
1. **Hero**: Problem + Agitation hook
2. **Section 2**: Deeper agitation (consequences, stats)
3. **Section 3**: Solution introduction
4. **Section 4**: How it works (plan)
5. **Section 5**: Proof (testimonials, case studies)
6. **Section 6**: CTA with solution recap

## B2B SaaS Examples

### Example 1: Productivity Platform
**Problem**: "Are repetitive manual tasks draining your team's productivity and morale?"

**Agitation**: "Left unchecked, these inefficient processes can cost your company thousands in wasted hours and lead to critical errors that erode client trust."

**Solution**: "Our SaaS platform automates routine tasks, helping teams reclaim 20% of their workday and maintain error-free records."

### Example 2: Sales Enablement Tool
**Problem**: "Your sales team spends more time on admin than selling."

**Agitation**: "While they're updating spreadsheets and searching for content, your competitors are closing deals. Every hour of admin work costs you $500 in potential revenue."

**Solution**: "Automate the busywork. Give your reps 10+ hours back every week with one-click proposals and smart content recommendations."

## Where to Use PAS

| Channel | How to Apply |
|---------|--------------|
| **Landing pages** | Full structure, hero through CTA |
| **Email subject + opener** | Problem in subject, agitate in first line |
| **LinkedIn posts** | Hook with problem, agitate in body, solve in CTA |
| **Paid ads** | Problem headline, agitation in description |
| **Blog intros** | Hook readers before delivering value |
| **Sales calls** | Discovery → pain points → solution positioning |

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Overplaying the Agitation
Don't dramatize problems that don't exist. Audiences detect manipulation.

> "Do not overplay your hand by dramatizing the problem too much. Summarize the words your customers would use to describe it."
>
> *Source: [Landing Rabbit](https://landingrabbit.com/blog/pas-formula)*

### ❌ Combining Multiple Problems
Pick the MOST painful problem. One page = one problem.

> "If you are using the PAS formula for the first time, choose the most painful problem your customers experience. Copywriting gets relatively tricky when you try to combine multiple problems on one page."

### ❌ Vague Problems
"Struggling with growth?" is weak. "Losing $50k/month to churn?" is specific.

### ❌ Disconnected Solution
Your solution must directly address the agitated problem. Don't pivot to unrelated benefits.

## PAS vs AIDA

| Aspect | PAS | AIDA |
|--------|-----|------|
| Starting point | Existing pain | Capturing attention |
| Emotional arc | Pain → Relief | Interest → Desire |
| Best audience | Problem-aware | Unaware or curious |
| Tone | Empathetic, urgent | Aspirational |
| Length | Works short or long | Often shorter |

**Use PAS when**: Audience knows they have a problem but hasn't found a solution
**Use AIDA when**: Audience may not be problem-aware yet
