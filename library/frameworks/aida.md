# AIDA: Attention-Interest-Desire-Action

> **Best for**: Ads, landing pages, email sequences, short-form copy
> **Complexity**: Low
> **Emotional depth**: Medium
> **Origin**: Elias St. Elmo Lewis, 1898

## Overview

AIDA is the foundational copywriting framework that breaks the customer journey into four sequential stages. Despite being over 125 years old, it remains effective because it mirrors how humans naturally process information and make decisions.

> "Developed by advertising pioneer Elias St. Elmo Lewis in 1898, the AIDA model has endured for over a century because its stages tap into fundamental human psychology, guiding consumers from initial awareness to conversion."

## The Four Stages

### 1. Attention
**Goal**: Stop the scroll. Make them notice you.

- Headlines, hooks, visuals that stand out
- Pattern interrupts
- Bold claims or unexpected statements
- Questions that resonate

**Techniques**:
- Numbers: "5 Ways to..."
- Questions: "Tired of...?"
- Controversy: "Everything you know about X is wrong"
- Specificity: "How I made $127,432 in 90 days"

**Example**:
> "Your competitors are stealing your customers. Here's how."

---

### 2. Interest
**Goal**: Keep them reading. Provide value that makes them want more.

> "Interest is about keeping your prospects interested enough to make them stay longer and hear or read your pitch until the end. It's an extension of the hook you came up with in the attention stage."
>

**Techniques**:
- Share surprising information
- Tell a relatable story
- Present a new perspective
- Tease the solution

**Example**:
> "Most businesses focus on acquiring new customers. But research shows that increasing retention by just 5% can boost profits by 25-95%."

---

### 3. Desire
**Goal**: Make them want what you offer. Show transformation.

> "Desire is about how your product or service improves the lives of your prospects. By making them see how your products will fit in with their lives and solve an ongoing issue, you can confidently spur action."
>

**Techniques**:
- Benefits over features
- Future pacing ("Imagine...")
- Social proof
- Scarcity and exclusivity

**Example**:
> "Imagine opening your dashboard every morning to see customer lifetime value increasing. No more churn anxiety. No more panic discounts."

---

### 4. Action
**Goal**: Tell them exactly what to do next.

> "Once you have created desire, quickly point your audience toward the action you want them to take. Use actionable language (buy, download, contact, discover) and make it clear what will happen when they click that CTA button."
>

**Techniques**:
- Clear, specific CTAs
- Urgency: "Offer ends at midnight"
- Risk reduction: "No credit card required"
- Friction removal: "Free shipping on all orders"

**Example**:
> "Start your free 14-day trial → No credit card required"

## AIDA Examples

### Landing Page Example (SaaS)

**Attention** (Headline):
> "Stop Losing 40% of Your Revenue to Churn"

**Interest** (Subheadline):
> "The average SaaS loses $1.2M annually to preventable cancellations. Most don't even know why customers leave."

**Desire** (Benefits section):
> "With RetainIQ, you'll:
> - Predict churn 30 days before it happens
> - Automate win-back campaigns that convert 23% of at-risk customers
> - See exactly why customers cancel (no more guessing)"

**Action** (CTA):
> "Start Free Trial — See your churn risk score in 5 minutes"

---

### Email Example (B2B)

**Attention** (Subject):
> "Your Q1 pipeline has a $200K problem"

**Interest** (Opening):
> "I analyzed 50 companies in your space. The average enterprise deal takes 47% longer than it should because of one fixable bottleneck."

**Desire** (Body):
> "Companies using our method close 3 weeks faster on average. That's $200K+ in accelerated revenue for a typical $2M pipeline."

**Action** (CTA):
> "Reply 'PIPELINE' and I'll send the 10-minute diagnostic."

## When AIDA Works Best

✅ **Use AIDA when**:
- You have enough space to develop all four stages
- Customers need emotional persuasion
- The offer is relatively simple
- You're guiding prospects through a complete journey

❌ **Skip AIDA when**:
- Audience is highly problem-aware (use PAS instead)
- You need complex brand messaging (use StoryBrand)
- Copy is extremely short (use hooks only)

---

## AIDA Variations

### AIDAR (with Retention)
Adds a fifth stage for repeat engagement:
- **Retention**: Follow-up, loyalty programs, community

### AIDCA (with Conviction)
Inserts "Conviction" before Action:
- **Conviction**: Overcoming final objections with proof

### AIDAS (with Satisfaction)
Adds post-purchase satisfaction:
- **Satisfaction**: Onboarding, support, referral

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Weak Attention
If the headline doesn't stop them, nothing else matters.

### ❌ Skipping Interest for Desire
Don't jump straight to selling. Build curiosity first.

### ❌ Features Instead of Benefits
"Our software has 50+ integrations" < "Connect every tool you use in 2 clicks"

### ❌ Vague CTA
"Learn More" < "Start Your Free Trial"
"Submit" < "Get My Report"

### ❌ Too Many CTAs
One primary CTA per section. Multiple CTAs create decision paralysis.
