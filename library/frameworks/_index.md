## Combining Frameworks

Frameworks aren't mutually exclusive. High-performing pages often combine elements:

### Common Combinations

**PAS + StoryBrand**
Use PAS structure with StoryBrand positioning (customer = hero, brand = guide)

**AIDA + Social Proof**
Classic AIDA flow with heavy testimonials in the Desire phase

**BAB + 4Ps**
Before/After transformation story with proof and push elements

## When NOT to Use Frameworks

Frameworks can become crutches. Skip them when:

- You know your audience deeply and can write naturally
- The context is highly unique (no existing pattern applies)
- You're testing radically different approaches

> "Frameworks stay relevant not because they are 'marketing formulas' but because they align with human cognitive patterns. Their impact depends on audience understanding, clarity, and credibility, not the framework itself."

## 2025 Trends

### AI-Assisted Frameworks
Frameworks are now embedded in AI tools like Buffer AI, Notion AI, and Yoast SEO AI+. This accelerates implementation but requires human oversight for authenticity.

### Attention Scarcity
> 58.5% of Google searches in 2024 ended without a single external click. Attention must be captured before the click — in the search snippet, headline, or first line.

### Authenticity Over Manipulation
Modern audiences detect formulaic copy. The best implementations feel natural, not templated. Focus on understanding your audience deeply, then use frameworks as guides, not scripts.
