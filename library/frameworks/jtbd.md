# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Framework

> **Best for**: Product strategy, positioning, user research, feature prioritization
> **Complexity**: Medium-High
> **Origin**: Clayton Christensen (Harvard Business School), Tony Ulwick, Bob Moesta
> **Core insight**: People don't buy products — they hire them to do jobs

---

## Overview

Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding customer motivations and behavior. It shifts focus from demographics and features to the underlying "job" customers are trying to accomplish.

> "People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."
>
> *— Theodore Levitt*

## Core Concepts

### The Job

A "job" is the progress a customer is trying to make in a particular circumstance. It's not about the product — it's about what the customer is trying to achieve.

**Job structure**:
```
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].
```

**Example**:
> "When I'm running late for a morning meeting, I want to grab something quick to eat, so I can have energy without being late."

This job explains why people "hire" fast food, protein bars, or meal prep services — not because they want those specific products, but because they solve that job.

### Three Layers of Jobs

| Layer | Description | Example (Project Management Tool) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Functional** | The practical task | "Organize tasks and deadlines" |
| **Emotional** | How they want to feel | "Feel in control, not overwhelmed" |
| **Social** | How they want to be perceived | "Be seen as a competent leader" |

> "Functional jobs get attention. Emotional and social jobs close deals."

## The JTBD Framework

### Job Map (Ulwick Method)

Tony Ulwick's Outcome-Driven Innovation maps jobs into 8 phases:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                        THE JOB MAP                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  1. DEFINE     What is the customer trying to accomplish?       │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  2. LOCATE     Find the inputs/resources needed                 │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  3. PREPARE    Get ready to do the job                         │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  4. CONFIRM    Verify readiness                                │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  5. EXECUTE    Do the core job                                 │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  6. MONITOR    Track progress                                  │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  7. MODIFY     Make adjustments as needed                      │
│       ↓                                                         │
│  8. CONCLUDE   Finish and wrap up                              │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Forces of Progress (Moesta Method)

Bob Moesta's "Four Forces" model explains why people switch (or don't switch) to new solutions:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │   NEW SOLUTION      │
                    └─────────────────────┘
                              ▲
           PUSH              │              PULL
    (Current pain)           │       (Attraction to new)
    ─────────────────►       │       ◄─────────────────
                             │
    ◄─────────────────       │       ─────────────────►
         ANXIETY             │            HABIT
    (Fear of change)         │       (Current comfort)
                              │
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
                    │   OLD SOLUTION      │
                    └─────────────────────┘
```

**For change to happen**: Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit

| Force | Direction | Questions to Ask |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| **Push** | Away from status quo | "What's frustrating about the current way?" |
| **Pull** | Toward new solution | "What attracted you to trying something new?" |
| **Anxiety** | Resists change | "What worried you about switching?" |
| **Habit** | Keeps status quo | "What about the old way was comfortable?" |

## JTBD Job Statement Formula

### Standard Format

```
When [situation/trigger],
I want to [job/motivation],
so I can [desired outcome].
```

### Enhanced Format (with constraints)

```
When [situation/trigger],
I want to [job/motivation],
so I can [desired outcome],
without [undesired outcome/constraint].
```

### Examples

**CRM Software**:
> "When I get off a sales call, I want to quickly log notes and next steps, so I can follow up effectively, without losing context or forgetting details."

**E-commerce**:
> "When I need a gift for someone I don't know well, I want to find something appropriate quickly, so I can seem thoughtful, without spending too much time or money."

**Fitness App**:
> "When I have 20 minutes between meetings, I want a quick workout I can do anywhere, so I can stay active, without needing equipment or changing clothes."

## JTBD Research Methods

### Switch Interviews

The most powerful JTBD research method: Interview people who recently switched to (or from) your product.

**Timeline mapping**:
```
FIRST THOUGHT ──► PASSIVE LOOKING ──► ACTIVE LOOKING ──► DECIDING ──► USING
     │                  │                   │               │           │
     ▼                  ▼                   ▼               ▼           ▼
  "Something's      "Noticed           "Started         "Chose      "Actually
   not right"       alternatives"      researching"     solution"   using it"
```

**Key questions**:
1. "Tell me about when you first started thinking about switching..."
2. "What was happening that made you look for a solution?"
3. "What did you try before finding us?"
4. "What almost stopped you from switching?"
5. "What finally made you decide?"

### Outcome Statements

Structured statements that define what success looks like:

**Format**:
```
[Direction] + the [metric] + of [object of control]
```

**Example outcomes for project management**:
- Minimize the time spent updating stakeholders on project status
- Minimize the likelihood of missing a deadline
- Increase the visibility of team workload
- Minimize the number of tools needed to manage a project

## Applying JTBD to Website Strategy

### Homepage Messaging

**Before JTBD (feature-focused)**:
> "The all-in-one project management platform with Gantt charts, Kanban boards, time tracking, and resource management."

**After JTBD (job-focused)**:
> "Deliver every project on time. Stop the chaos of scattered tasks, missed deadlines, and overwhelmed teams."

### Value Proposition

Use JTBD insights to craft value props:

| Job Layer | Insight | Messaging |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Functional | "Organize scattered tasks" | "Everything in one place" |
| Emotional | "Feel in control" | "Finally feel on top of things" |
| Social | "Be seen as competent" | "Lead with confidence" |

### Feature Prioritization

Map features to jobs, not vice versa:

| Job | Feature | Priority |
|-----|---------|----------|
| "Quickly capture ideas" | Mobile quick-add | High |
| "Know what's urgent" | Smart priorities | High |
| "Show progress to stakeholders" | Status dashboards | Medium |
| "Customize my workflow" | Custom fields | Lower |

## JTBD by Industry

### SaaS / B2B

**Common jobs**:
- "Look good to my boss" (career advancement)
- "Save time on repetitive tasks" (efficiency)
- "Reduce risk of mistakes" (safety)
- "Prove ROI of my decisions" (justification)

**Research focus**: Interview the buyer, the user, and the economic decision-maker separately.

### E-commerce

**Common jobs**:
- "Find the right product without wasting time"
- "Get a good deal without feeling cheated"
- "Feel confident I'm making the right choice"
- "Have something to show for my purchase"

**Research focus**: Interview post-purchase to understand the full decision journey.

### Healthcare

**Common jobs**:
- "Understand what's wrong with me" (diagnosis)
- "Feel heard by my provider" (emotional)
- "Get better without disrupting my life" (convenience)
- "Trust the advice I'm receiving" (authority)

### Local Services

**Common jobs**:
- "Solve my problem quickly" (urgency)
- "Trust that the person is qualified" (credibility)
- "Know what it will cost" (transparency)
- "Not get ripped off" (fear reduction)

---

## JTBD vs. Personas

| Aspect | Personas | JTBD |
|--------|----------|------|
| Focus | Who the customer is | What the customer wants to accomplish |
| Basis | Demographics, psychographics | Situations, motivations, outcomes |
| Risk | Stereotyping, overgeneralization | Ignoring customer diversity |
| Best for | Marketing targeting | Product design, messaging |

**Best practice**: Use both. JTBD for motivation, personas for targeting.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Confusing Jobs with Tasks

**Task**: "Create a Gantt chart"
**Job**: "Communicate project timeline to stakeholders clearly"

Tasks are HOW. Jobs are WHY.

### ❌ Focusing Only on Functional Jobs

Emotional and social jobs often drive decisions more than functional ones.

### ❌ Defining Jobs Too Broadly

**Too broad**: "Be more productive"
**Better**: "Complete my weekly review in under 30 minutes"

### ❌ Ignoring the Situation/Trigger

Jobs are context-dependent. "Getting a coffee" is different when you're:
- Rushing to work
- Meeting a friend
- Taking a break
