## Overview

SLAP is a 4-step copywriting formula designed for fast, low-cost offers that convert through impulse rather than deliberation. It's built around hijacking attention, sparking instant desire, and removing friction.

> "SLAP is all about hijacking attention, sparking desire, and removing friction. You don't sell logic here — you sell emotion and speed."

Unlike frameworks designed for complex sales (SPIN, PASTOR), SLAP assumes:
- Short attention spans
- Low financial risk for the buyer
- Emotional/impulse decision-making
- Minimal research before purchase

## The Four Steps

### 1. Stop

**Goal**: Interrupt the scroll. Make them freeze.

The first step is creating a headline, hook, or visual that grabs attention instantly. In a world of infinite content, you have less than 2 seconds to stop someone.

**Techniques**:
- Pattern interrupts (unexpected visuals or statements)
- Bold, provocative claims
- Questions that hit pain points
- Contrarian statements
- Numbers and specificity

**Examples**:
- "Your skincare routine is making you age faster"
- "This $12 tool replaced my $500 standing desk"
- "I deleted my to-do list app. Here's what happened."
- "90% of home cooks make this mistake"

> "It should be provocative, intriguing, and relevant to the audience's needs and interests."

### 2. Look

**Goal**: Keep them engaged. Make them want more.

Once you've stopped them, the Look phase keeps them reading. This is where you deliver value, build curiosity, and make them feel like they've found something worth their time.

**Techniques**:
- Visual appeal (clean layout, engaging images)
- Easy-to-scan content
- Highlight the unique value proposition
- Tease the benefit without giving everything away

**Content Focus**:
- What makes this product/offer unique?
- What problem does it solve?
- Why should they care right now?

**Example**:
> "Most desk organizers look like they belong in a cubicle from 1995. This one was designed by a former Apple engineer. It holds everything you need in 6 inches of space — and actually looks good on camera."

---

### 3. Act

**Goal**: Guide them toward the next step.

With attention captured and interest built, Act creates urgency and gives them a clear path forward. This isn't the final purchase yet — it's the commitment to engage further.

**Techniques**:
- Clear call-to-action
- Urgency or scarcity (when genuine)
- Low-friction next steps
- Incentives (discount, bonus, free shipping)

**Examples**:
- "Tap to see colors"
- "Swipe for the before/after"
- "Click to see if it's still in stock"
- "Download the free guide"

> "Create a sense of urgency or sweeten the deal with incentives."

### 4. Purchase

**Goal**: Convert interest into transaction.

The final step transforms engagement into a sale. This is where you address final objections, reduce risk, and make buying the obvious choice.

**Techniques**:
- Clear pricing (no hidden costs)
- Risk reversals (money-back guarantee, free returns)
- Trust signals (reviews, ratings, security badges)
- Seamless checkout experience
- Multiple payment options

**Elements**:
- ✅ Price clarity
- ✅ Shipping information
- ✅ Return policy visible
- ✅ Social proof near CTA
- ✅ Multiple payment methods

> "This changed how I organize my entire kitchen" [eye-catching image of transformation]

**Purchase** (Conversion):
> "Free shipping ends tonight. 30-day returns if you don't love it."

### Digital Product (Low-ticket)

**Stop**:
> "I made $2,400 from a 12-page PDF"

**Look**:
> "Everyone says 'build a course.' I don't have time for that. So I packaged my best framework into a simple template. Took 3 hours to create. Sold 200 copies at $12 each."

**Act**:
> "I'm sharing the exact template I used. Steal it."

**Purchase**:
> "Get the template for $9. Use it in 10 minutes. No fluff, just the framework."
> [Get It Now]

**Stop**:
> [Notification sound] "This app saves me $127/month on groceries"

**Look**:
> "It scans my receipts, finds better prices, and shows me which stores have deals on stuff I actually buy. No coupons to clip. No meal planning required."

**Act**:
> "Download free on iOS/Android"

**Purchase**:
> "Join 2M+ users saving an average of $1,200/year"
> [Download Now — Free]
