# StoryBrand: The 7-Part Messaging Framework

> **Best for**: Brand messaging, homepages, pitch decks, complex offerings
> **Complexity**: High
> **Emotional depth**: Very High
> **Creator**: Donald Miller

---

## Overview

The StoryBrand Framework is a messaging tool that clarifies your message by positioning your customer as the hero of the story, and your brand as the guide who helps them succeed.

> "The Hero of your brand story is not you. The Hero is your Customer. They need a Guide to help them fulfill their destiny. You are the Guide."

## The Core Principle

> "If you confuse, you lose."

People don't buy from the company with the most clever words. They buy from the company that explains things the clearest.

---

## The 7-Part Framework (SB7)

### The Story Arc

> A **CHARACTER** who wants something encounters a **PROBLEM** before they can get what they want. At the peak of their despair, a **GUIDE** steps into their lives, gives them a **PLAN**, and **CALLS THEM TO ACTION**. That action helps the character avoid **FAILURE** and ends in a **SUCCESS**.

## Deep Dive: Each Element

### 1. Character (The Customer)
**Your customer is the hero, not your brand.**

- Define what your customer wants
- Be specific about their desire
- This becomes your value proposition

**Questions to answer**:
- What do they want related to your offering?
- What's their aspirational identity?

**Example**: A project manager who wants to deliver projects on time without burnout.

---

### 2. Problem (Three Layers)
**Every hero faces obstacles. Define yours at three levels.**

| Layer | Description | Example (Project Management SaaS) |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **External** | The tangible, surface-level problem | "Projects keep running over deadline" |
| **Internal** | How it makes them feel | "I feel like I'm failing my team" |
| **Philosophical** | Why it's wrong on a deeper level | "Hard work should lead to success, not chaos" |

> "The external problem is what's happening, the internal is how it feels, and the philosophical is why it matters."
>
> *Source: [Creativeo](https://www.creativeo.co/post/storybrand-framework)*

**Pro tip**: Most companies only address the external problem. Addressing internal and philosophical problems creates deeper connection.

---

### 3. Guide (Your Brand)
**You are the experienced mentor, not the hero.**

Two key qualities of a guide:

| Quality | What it means | How to show it |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Empathy** | You understand their struggle | "We've seen teams struggle with this..." |
| **Authority** | You have the expertise to help | Testimonials, credentials, experience |

**Example**:
> "After helping 500+ teams ship on time, we've learned that the problem isn't people — it's process."

---

### 4. Plan (The Path Forward)
**Give them a simple, clear path that breaks through confusion.**

Two types of plans:

**Process Plan** (How it works)
- 3-4 simple steps
- Reduces perceived complexity
- Example: "1. Sign up → 2. Import your projects → 3. Watch deadlines happen"

**Agreement Plan** (What you promise)
- Addresses fears and objections
- Example: "No long-term contracts. Cancel anytime. 30-day money back."

---

### 5. Call to Action
**Don't hope they take action — invite them clearly.**

Two types of CTAs:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Direct CTA** | Primary action, stands out | "Start Free Trial" |
| **Transitional CTA** | Softer, builds relationship | "Download the Guide" |

**Every page needs both.** Direct CTA for ready buyers, transitional for those who need more time.

---

### 6. Success (The Stakes of Winning)
**Paint a picture of how life improves if they act.**

- Be specific and aspirational
- Connect to their internal desires
- Make it vivid

**Example**:
> "Imagine ending each week knowing every project is on track. Your team respects your leadership. You leave work on time."

---

### 7. Failure (The Stakes of Inaction)
**Show what's at stake if they do nothing.**

- Be honest, not manipulative
- Focus on natural consequences
- Don't overdo fear

**Example**:
> "Without a system, deadlines will keep slipping. Team morale drops. Eventually, clients leave."

> "An honest view of what's at stake if they do nothing."

## Website Application

### Homepage Structure Using StoryBrand

| Section | SB7 Element | Content |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Hero | Character + Problem | What they want + obstacle |
| Value Prop | Problem (deeper) | Internal/philosophical problem |
| Guide Intro | Guide | Empathy + Authority |
| How It Works | Plan | 3-step process |
| Testimonials | Guide (Authority) | Social proof |
| Success/Failure | Stakes | What they gain/avoid |
| CTA | Call to Action | Direct + Transitional |

### Header (Above the Fold)

The header should answer three questions in 5 seconds:
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. What do I need to do to get it?

---

## The BrandScript

StoryBrand uses a "BrandScript" — a one-page document that captures all 7 elements. Complete this before writing any copy.

```
CHARACTER
What does your customer want?
_________________________________

PROBLEM
External: ________________________
Internal: ________________________
Philosophical: ____________________

GUIDE
Empathy: _________________________
Authority: ________________________

PLAN
Step 1: __________________________
Step 2: __________________________
Step 3: __________________________

CALL TO ACTION
Direct: __________________________
Transitional: _____________________

SUCCESS
What does success look like?
_________________________________

FAILURE

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Making Your Brand the Hero
Your brand is the guide, not the protagonist. Brands that talk about themselves too much lose customers.

### ❌ Skipping the Internal Problem
External problems get attention. Internal problems close sales.

### ❌ Too Many Steps in the Plan
3-4 steps maximum. More than that increases perceived complexity.

### ❌ Weak or Missing Failure Stakes
If there's no cost to inaction, there's no urgency to act.

### ❌ Unclear CTA
"Learn More" is weak. "Start Your Free Trial" is clear.

## StoryBrand vs Other Frameworks

| Aspect | StoryBrand | PAS | AIDA |
|--------|------------|-----|------|
| Hero | Customer | Implied customer | Implied customer |
| Brand role | Guide | Solution provider | Attention grabber |
| Depth | 7 elements | 3 elements | 4 elements |
| Best for | Full brand messaging | Problem-focused copy | Quick conversions |
| Complexity | High | Low | Low |

**Use StoryBrand when**: You need comprehensive brand messaging across all touchpoints
**Use PAS when**: You have a specific pain point to address
**Use AIDA when**: You need quick-hit copy (ads, emails)

---

## Real-World Examples

### Slack (Implied StoryBrand)
- **Character**: Teams who want to work better together
- **Problem**: Email is chaotic, information gets lost
- **Guide**: Slack (trusted by millions of teams)
- **Plan**: Download → Create workspace → Invite team
- **Success**: "Where work happens" — organized, efficient
- **Failure**: Continued chaos, missed messages

### Basecamp
- **Character**: Teams drowning in tools
- **Problem**: "Before Basecamp: Projects feel scattered"
- **Guide**: "We've been doing this for 20 years"
- **Success**: "After Basecamp: Everything in one place"
