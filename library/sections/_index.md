# Section Patterns Catalog

> **Purpose**: This catalog documents proven section patterns for building high-converting pages. Each section has ONE job — combine them strategically to guide visitors from attention → interest → trust → action.

---

## The Universal Page Flow

Most high-converting pages follow this general section order:

```
1. Hero              → Capture attention, state value proposition
2. Social Proof #1   → Build immediate credibility (logos, badges)
3. Problem/Benefits  → Address pain points or show benefits
4. How It Works      → Reduce complexity with simple steps
5. Features          → Detail what they get
6. Social Proof #2   → Deep proof (testimonials, case studies)
7. Pricing/Offer     → Present the deal
8. FAQ               → Handle objections
9. Final CTA         → Last push to action
10. Footer           → Trust signals, navigation
```

> "The flow that usually works best: Start with a hero section – a big headline and a strong CTA. Then, dive into your value proposition or key benefits. Follow that up with social proof. After that, present your form or main CTA. Below that, include any extra details like features or FAQs. End with a final CTA to give them one last nudge."

## Section Design Principles

### 1. One Section = One Message
Don't overload sections with multiple purposes. Each section should have a single, clear job.

### 2. Visual Hierarchy
Use size, contrast, and spacing to guide the eye. The most important element should be most prominent.

### 3. Consistent Rhythm
Maintain consistent spacing between sections. Alternate section styles (light/dark, image left/right) to create visual rhythm.

### 4. Mobile-First
Design sections that work vertically first, then enhance for desktop.

### 5. CTA Presence
Every section should either have a CTA or lead naturally to the next section.
