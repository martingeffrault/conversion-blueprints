# Hero Section: Above the Fold Essentials

> **Purpose**: The hero section is the most critical real estate on any page. It must capture attention, communicate value, and prompt action — all within seconds.

---

## The 5-Second Test

Your hero section should answer three questions in 5 seconds or less:

1. **What do you offer?**
2. **How will it make my life better?**
3. **What do I need to do to get it?**

> "Visitors often form opinions about a website within 0.05 seconds."

## Essential Elements

### 1. Headline (Most Important)
The headline is the single most important element on any page.

> "Only 20% of visitors read beyond the headline. The headline is the most important element on any page."
>
> *Source: [CXL](https://cxl.com/blog/how-to-build-a-high-converting-landing-page/)*

**Headline best practices**:
- 5-7 words maximum for the main headline
- Focus on the primary benefit, not the product
- Use power words that create emotion
- Be specific when possible (numbers, outcomes)

**Headline formulas**:
| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| [Outcome] without [Pain] | "Lose weight without giving up carbs" |
| [Action] your [Object] in [Timeframe] | "Double your leads in 30 days" |
| The [Adjective] way to [Outcome] | "The fastest way to learn Spanish" |
| Stop [Pain]. Start [Benefit] | "Stop guessing. Start growing." |
| [Number] [Object] that [Outcome] | "5 emails that close deals" |

---

### 2. Subheadline
Expands on the headline with additional context.

- 1-2 sentences maximum
- Explain the "how" if headline explains "what"
- Can address a secondary benefit
- Should flow naturally from headline

**Example**:
- **Headline**: "Double your email open rates in 30 days"
- **Subheadline**: "Our AI analyzes your audience and writes subject lines that actually get clicks."

### 3. Hero Image/Visual
The visual should complement the message, not compete with it.

> "A key aspect of hero image design is ensuring it doesn't overpower the text or other elements. The image should complement the headline and CTA rather than compete with them for attention."
>
> *Source: [Prismic](https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)*

**Visual options**:
| Type | Best For |
|------|----------|
| Product screenshot | SaaS, software |
| Lifestyle photo | B2C, aspirational |
| Illustration | Abstract concepts, tech |
| Video background | High-impact, luxury |
| No image (color/gradient) | Minimalist, focused LPs |

**Image optimization**:
- Preload the LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) image
- Compress to under 200KB when possible
- Use next-gen formats (WebP, AVIF)

---

### 4. Call-to-Action (CTA)
The CTA should be clear, visible, and action-oriented.

> "Effective CTAs use verbs that prompt movement, like 'Start Free Trial,' 'Get Quote,' or 'See Plans.' Placement is key: the CTA should be located above the fold and not buried beneath long paragraphs."
>
> *Source: [Omniconvert](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/hero-section-examples/)*

**CTA best practices**:
- One primary CTA (avoid multiple competing options)
- Use action verbs: Start, Get, Join, Download, Try
- State the outcome: "Get My Report" > "Submit"
- Add friction reducers: "No credit card required"
- Make it visually prominent (color contrast, size)

**Primary + Secondary pattern**:
```
[Primary CTA: Bold, contrasting color]
[Secondary CTA: Text link or outline button]
```

Example:
- **Primary**: "Start Free Trial"
- **Secondary**: "See how it works →"

---

### 5. Trust Elements (Optional but Powerful)
Secondary elements that boost credibility without competing for attention.

> "Trust elements like trust badges, short testimonials, logos of clients, or key benefits often appear near the CTA to provide reassurance. These micro-elements can significantly influence conversion by addressing objections or boosting credibility."
>
> *Source: [Omniconvert](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/hero-section-examples/)*

**Trust element options**:
- Client logos (3-5 recognizable brands)
- Star rating with review count
- Security badges
- "Trusted by X customers"
- Short testimonial quote
- Award badges

## The Z-Pattern

> "Present the information you want the user to interact with in a Z pattern, ending the above-the-fold section with a call to action, usually at the end of the Z pattern in the bottom right."
>
> *Source: [ConvertCart](https://www.convertcart.com/blog/above-the-fold-content)*

```
[Logo] -------- [Nav] -------- [CTA]
   \                             /
    \                           /
     -------- [Content] --------
    /                           \
   /                             \
[Trust] ------- [Main CTA] ------
```

## Mobile Considerations

> "Since mobile screens prioritize vertical layouts, stack content in a logical order, with the headline and CTA appearing first. Ensure buttons and links are large enough to be tapped easily, with adequate spacing to prevent accidental clicks."
>
> *Source: [Omniconvert](https://www.omniconvert.com/blog/above-the-fold-design/)*

**Mobile hero checklist**:
- [ ] Headline fully visible without scrolling
- [ ] CTA above fold on mobile
- [ ] Touch targets at least 44x44px
- [ ] Adequate spacing between elements
- [ ] Image doesn't push content below fold
- [ ] Text readable without zooming

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too Much Content
> "Adding too much clutter to your above the fold content can result in a bad user experience, making it challenging for visitors to determine the purpose of your website."
>
> *Source: [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/resources/what-is-above-the-fold/)*

### ❌ Oversized Header
> "One of the common mistakes is keeping too long a header section. As a result, the hero section gets too little space to create an impression."
>
> *Source: [ConvertCart](https://www.convertcart.com/blog/above-the-fold-content)*

### ❌ Mismatched Message
If visitors came from an ad, the hero must match the ad's promise.

> "If your banner or PPC ad promised a 'Breakthrough meditation system,' then this phrase should also be in the headline of your landing page."
>
> *Source: [Thrive Themes](https://thrivethemes.com/optimal-landing-page-structure/)*

### ❌ Generic CTA
"Learn More" and "Submit" are weak. Be specific about what happens next.

### ❌ Competing CTAs
Multiple CTAs create decision paralysis. Prioritize one clear action.
