### Field Count Impact

> "Each form field you remove can increase conversions by up to 10%."
>
> *Source: [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/conversion-rate-optimization/b2b-conversion-rates/)*

### Demo Form Fields

| Field | Required | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|

**Recommended minimum: 2-3 fields**

### Trial Form Fields
