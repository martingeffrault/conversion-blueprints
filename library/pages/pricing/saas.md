# SaaS Pricing Page Blueprint

> **Purpose**: Convert visitors who are evaluating your solution
> **Audience**: Comparison shoppers, decision-makers evaluating options
> **Goal**: Reduce friction, answer objections, drive signup/demo

---

## Core Principle

The pricing page is where deals are won or lost. Visitors here are **high-intent** — they're evaluating whether to buy. Your job is to:

1. Make the decision easy (clear options, obvious recommendation)
2. Remove friction (answer questions before they're asked)
3. Build confidence (social proof, guarantees, security)

> "The pricing page is often the second-most visited page on SaaS websites after the homepage."

## Section 1: Hero/Header

Keep it simple — visitors know why they're here.

### Elements

- **Headline**: Value-focused, not "Pricing"
- **Subheadline**: Reinforce the outcome
- **Trust signal**: Quick stat or social proof

### Headline Examples

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Value-focused | "Invest in your team's productivity" |
| Outcome-focused | "Choose the plan that grows with you" |
| Simple | "Simple, transparent pricing" |
| Benefit | "Plans for teams of every size" |

### What to Avoid

- Generic "Our Pricing" headlines
- Long paragraphs of text
- Competing CTAs in the header

---

## Section 2: Pricing Toggle

For products with monthly/annual billing.

### Best Practices

> "Highlighting the annual discount percentage (e.g., 'Save 20%') next to the toggle increases annual plan selection."
>
> *Source: SaaS conversion optimization studies*

**Toggle design**:
```
[Monthly] [Annual - Save 20%]
         ↑ Highlighted, often pre-selected
```

**Key considerations**:
- Pre-select annual if it's the preferred option
- Show savings clearly (percentage or amount)
- Make the toggle visually prominent
- Consider showing monthly price even for annual (e.g., "$10/mo billed annually")

---

## Section 3: Pricing Tiers (Critical)

The core of the page. Get this right.

### The Rule of Three (or Four)

> "Three pricing tiers is optimal for most SaaS. It provides a clear good/better/best hierarchy without overwhelming visitors."

| Tier | Purpose | Positioning |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Starter/Basic** | Entry point, price anchor | "For individuals/small teams" |
| **Professional** | Most popular, highest margin | "For growing teams" — HIGHLIGHT THIS |
| **Enterprise** | High-value, custom | "For large organizations" |
| **Free** (optional) | Lead gen, freemium | "Get started" — if your model supports it |

### Visual Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐  ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │  │ ★ MOST POPULAR  │  │                 │
│    STARTER      │  │                 │  │   ENTERPRISE    │
│                 │  │  PROFESSIONAL   │  │                 │
│    $29/mo       │  │                 │  │   Custom        │
│                 │  │    $79/mo       │  │                 │
│  [Start Free]   │  │                 │  │  [Contact Us]   │
│                 │  │  [Start Trial]  │  │                 │
└─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
                            ↑
                     Visually elevated
                     (border, shadow, scale)
```

### Tier Card Elements

Each tier should include:

1. **Plan name**: Clear, descriptive
2. **Price**: Large, prominent
3. **Billing period**: /month, /year, /user
4. **Target user**: "Best for..." or "Ideal for..."
5. **Key features**: 4-6 bullet points
6. **CTA button**: Action-oriented
7. **Popular badge**: On recommended tier (optional)

### Pricing Display Best Practices

**Price anchoring**:
- Show original price crossed out for discounts
- Display per-user pricing if applicable
- Include "starting at" for variable pricing

**Formatting**:
```
$79        ← Large, bold
/month     ← Smaller, muted
per user   ← Even smaller (if applicable)
```

### Feature Differentiation

Make the value difference clear between tiers:

| Feature Strategy | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Quantity limits** | 5 users → 25 users → Unlimited |
| **Feature access** | Basic reports → Advanced analytics → Custom dashboards |
| **Support level** | Email → Priority email → Dedicated manager |
| **Integrations** | 3 integrations → 10 integrations → All integrations |

---

## Section 4: Feature Comparison Table

For visitors who want the full picture.

### Table Structure

```
| Feature              | Starter | Pro ✓ | Enterprise |
|---------------------|---------|-------|------------|
| Users               | 5       | 25    | Unlimited  |
| Storage             | 10 GB   | 100 GB| Unlimited  |
| API Access          | ❌      | ✓     | ✓          |
| Custom Branding     | ❌      | ✓     | ✓          |
| Priority Support    | ❌      | ✓     | ✓          |
| Dedicated Manager   | ❌      | ❌    | ✓          |
| SSO/SAML           | ❌      | ❌    | ✓          |
| Custom Integrations | ❌      | ❌    | ✓          |
```

### Best Practices

- **Group features** by category (Core, Advanced, Support, Security)
- **Highlight differences** — gray out included features, emphasize upgrades
- **Use checkmarks and X** — visually scannable
- **Sticky header** — keep tier names visible while scrolling
- **Add tier CTAs** at the bottom of the table

### Feature Grouping Example

## Section 5: Social Proof

Reinforce the decision with proof.

### Placement Options

1. **Between tiers and FAQ** — Natural reading flow
2. **Alongside tiers** — Immediate reinforcement
3. **Below FAQ** — Final push before decision

|------|----------|---------|
| **Customer logos** | B2B, enterprise | "Trusted by..." |

| **Case studies** | High-ticket | "See how [Company] grew 3x" |
| **Reviews** | SMB | G2/Capterra badges |

### Testimonial Focus for Pricing Pages

Choose testimonials that address:
- **Value for money** — "Worth every penny"
- **ROI** — "Paid for itself in 2 months"
- **Comparison** — "Better than [competitor]"
- **Plan upgrade** — "Started with Basic, now on Pro"

## Conversion Optimization Tips

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Highlight recommended plan** — Border, shadow, scale, or badge
2. **Use contrast** — Make CTAs stand out
3. **Reduce clutter** — White space helps decisions

### Reducing Friction

1. **No credit card for trial** — If possible
2. **Clear cancellation** — "Cancel anytime"
3. **Transparent pricing** — No hidden fees
4. **Quick comparison** — Easy to scan differences

### A/B Testing Ideas

- Toggle pre-selection (monthly vs. annual)
- Number of tiers (3 vs. 4)
- CTA copy ("Start Free" vs. "Try for Free")
- Tier names (Starter/Pro/Enterprise vs. Basic/Plus/Premium)
- Price anchoring (show vs. hide original price)

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Too Many Options

> "More than 4 tiers creates decision paralysis. Stick to 3 for most cases."

### ❌ No Highlighted Tier

Without a "recommended" option, visitors have to work harder to decide.

### ❌ Hidden Pricing

"Contact us for pricing" loses self-serve customers. Show at least a starting price.

### ❌ Feature Overload

Don't list every feature. Focus on differentiators between tiers.

### ❌ Weak CTAs

"Submit" or "Buy Now" are less effective than "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started".

### ❌ No Trust Elements

Enterprise buyers especially need security and compliance signals.

---

## Mobile Considerations

- **Stack tiers vertically** — One at a time
- **Highlight recommended** — Make it appear first or be most prominent
- **Sticky CTA** — Keep primary action visible
- **Collapsible comparison** — Don't show full table by default
- **Touch-friendly toggles** — Large enough to tap
