## Universal Page Principles

### 1. One Primary Goal Per Page
Every page should have a single, clear objective. Secondary goals are fine, but one goal dominates.

### 2. Clear Visual Hierarchy
The most important element should be most visually prominent. Use size, contrast, color, and whitespace strategically.

### 3. Consistent CTA Placement
Place CTAs at decision points:
- After value is communicated
- Before and after major sections
- At natural scroll pauses

### 4. Mobile-First Structure
Design for vertical scrolling first. Content should make sense when stacked.

### 5. Message Match
The page headline should match what brought the visitor there (ad copy, search query, referring page).

## Page Length Guidelines

| Goal | Recommended Length | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Free offer | Short (1-2 scrolls) | Low commitment = less convincing needed |
| Low-cost purchase | Medium (2-4 scrolls) | Some objection handling |
| High-cost purchase | Long (4+ scrolls) | Extensive proof and detail needed |
| Information/content | Varies | As long as value justifies |

> "In most cases, if the offer is free, short copy works better. If you're asking for money, longer copy performs better. The more money, the longer the copy."

## Section Ordering Principles

### The Universal Flow
```
1. Attention    → Hero/Hook
2. Interest     → Value proposition
3. Credibility  → Social proof
4. Desire       → Benefits/Features
5. Trust        → More proof, guarantees
6. Action       → CTA
```

### Attention Budget
Visitors have limited attention. Front-load the most important information:
- First 5 seconds: Value prop clear
- First 30 seconds: Should understand the offer
- First 2 minutes: Enough info to decide
