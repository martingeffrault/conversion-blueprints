# Comparison/Roundup Article Blueprint

> **Purpose**: Help readers choose the best product in a category

## Core Principle

Comparison articles are decision-stage content. Readers are ready to buy — they just need help choosing. Your job is to:
1. Quickly surface the best options
2. Provide enough detail for confident decisions
3. Make it easy to purchase through your links

> "Most people don't want to read the whole article—they just want the key information in bite-size summary to know whether it's right for them."
