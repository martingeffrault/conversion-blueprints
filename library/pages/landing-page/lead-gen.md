# Lead Generation Landing Page

> **Purpose**: Convert visitors into leads by offering something valuable in exchange for contact information.
> **Primary Goal**: Form submissions
> **Typical Conversion Rate**: 6.6% average, 10-15%+ for optimized pages — [Unbounce Q4 2024](https://unbounce.com/average-conversion-rates-landing-pages/)

---

## Core Principle

A lead gen page has ONE job: get the form filled out. Everything on the page should support that goal. Remove anything that doesn't.

> "Eliminate distractions by removing menus and links. Every element should drive toward one clear action. Too many options create decision fatigue."
