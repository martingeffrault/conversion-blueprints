## What is a Landing Page?

A landing page is a standalone page designed for a single conversion goal, typically reached through ads, email, or campaigns. Unlike homepages, landing pages remove distractions to focus on one action.

### Landing Page vs Homepage

| Aspect | Homepage | Landing Page |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Navigation | Full site nav | Minimal or none |
| Goals | Multiple | Single |
| Audience | All visitors | Specific segment |
| Traffic source | Organic, direct | Paid, campaigns |
| Content | Comprehensive | Focused |
