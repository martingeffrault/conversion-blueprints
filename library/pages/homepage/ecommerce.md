# E-commerce Homepage Blueprint

> **Purpose**: Showcase products, enable discovery, and drive visitors into the shopping funnel
> **Primary Goals**: Product discovery, category navigation, direct purchases
> **Typical Conversion Rate**: 1.88% average (Jan 2025), top performers 3-5%

---

## Core Principle

An e-commerce homepage is a storefront window and navigation hub. It must:
1. Immediately showcase compelling products
2. Make category navigation effortless
3. Build trust through social proof
4. Create urgency with promotions and limited offers

> "80% of users spend their time viewing directly above that page fold."

## Section 2: Header / Navigation

Critical for e-commerce — navigation drives discovery.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [☰] [LOGO]    [Search________________________🔍]   [♡] [👤] [🛒]  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ New Arrivals | Women | Men | Kids | Sale | Collections           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key elements**:
- Prominent search bar (not just icon)

```

**Split Hero with Product**:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Avoid Auto-Sliding Carousels

> "Swap out your hero-image auto-slide carousel."
>
> *Source: [GoInFlow](https://www.goinflow.com/blog/ecommerce-homepage-best-practices/)*

**Why**: Users often miss slides, conversion rates are lower, and it adds page weight.

**Alternative**: Static hero with clear CTA, or manual navigation controls.

## Section 4: Trust Bar
