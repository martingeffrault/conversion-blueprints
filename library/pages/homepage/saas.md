# SaaS Homepage Blueprint

> **Purpose**: Orient visitors, communicate value, and route them to the right next step
> **Primary Goals**: Drive trials, demos, or deeper exploration
> **Typical Conversion Rate**: 3.8% median, 11-24% for top performers

---

## Core Principle

A SaaS homepage isn't a landing page — it serves multiple audiences with different intents. It must:
1. Quickly communicate what you do
2. Build credibility with social proof
3. Route visitors to the right path (trial, demo, features, pricing)

> "Great SaaS homepages don't try to do too much, but they get the important stuff right. Within seconds, you should know what the product does, who it's for, and why it's worth your time."
>

## Section 1: Hero

The hero must answer three questions in 5 seconds:
1. What do you do?
2. How will it help me?
3. What should I do next?

### Layout: Centered (Most Common for SaaS)

```
[Logo]        [Features] [Pricing] [Login]    [CTA: Try Free]

                  [HEADLINE]
              [Subheadline text]

        [Primary CTA]    [Secondary CTA]

              [Product Screenshot/Demo]

        Trusted by: [Logo] [Logo] [Logo] [Logo]
```

### Hero Elements

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| **Headline** | Benefit-focused, 5-10 words |
| **Subheadline** | Clarify the how or who, 1-2 sentences |
| **Primary CTA** | "Start Free Trial", "Get Started Free" |
| **Secondary CTA** | "Book a Demo", "See How It Works" |
| **Visual** | Product screenshot, demo video, or animation |
| **Social proof** | Logo cloud or "Trusted by X companies" |

### Headline Examples

- "The all-in-one platform for [outcome]"
- "[Action] [faster/better/easier] with [Product]"
- "Stop [pain]. Start [outcome]."
- "[Outcome] without [pain point]"

## Section 2: Logo Cloud

Immediately after hero — provides instant credibility.

```
Trusted by 10,000+ teams worldwide
