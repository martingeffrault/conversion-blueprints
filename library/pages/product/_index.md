## What Are Product/Service Pages?

Product and service pages are where the conversion decision happens. Unlike homepages or landing pages that attract attention, these pages must provide enough information to close the sale or generate a qualified lead.

## Universal Principles

### Above the Fold Essentials

Every product/service page needs above the fold:

```
PRODUCT/SERVICE PAGE ABOVE FOLD

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Navigation]                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│     Clear identification                │
│     (Product name / Service type)       │
│                                         │
│     Value indicator                     │
│     (Price / Outcome / Benefit)         │
│                                         │
│     [Primary CTA]                       │
│                                         │
│     Trust signal                        │
│     (Rating / Credential / Badge)       │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Information Architecture

All product/service pages follow this flow:

```
1. Identification
   └── What is this? Who is it for?

2. Value
   └── Why should I care? What's the benefit?

3. Proof
   └── Why should I trust you?

4. Details
   └── Tell me more specifics

5. Objections
   └── Address my concerns

6. Action
   └── What's the next step?
```

### Conversion Fundamentals

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reduce friction** | Fewer form fields, clear CTAs |
| **Build trust** | Social proof, credentials, guarantees |
| **Show value** | Benefits over features |
| **Create urgency** | Stock levels, time limits, demand |
| **Enable comparison** | vs. alternatives, pricing tiers |
