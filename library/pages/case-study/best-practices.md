## Why Case Studies Matter

Case studies are the #1 marketing tactic for driving B2B sales. They bridge the gap between claims and proof.

> "In a 2024 survey of 115 SaaS marketers, case studies ranked as the #1 marketing tactic for driving sales — but only credible, well-told studies perform."

## Core Principle

A case study page must answer three questions:
1. **Who** is this customer? (Relatability)
2. **What** did they achieve? (Results)
3. **How** did your solution help? (Credibility)

> "The headline is arguably the most important element. Unlike a blog post, case study headlines should always focus on a specific result."

## Section 1: Hero (Impact-First)

The hero must immediately communicate results and establish credibility. Lead with the outcome, not the company name.

### Headline Formula

Three required elements:
1. **Customer company name** — Shows it's real
2. **Product/service used** — Helps readers assess relevance
3. **Specific result** — The hook

**Examples**:
- "How Acme Corp reduced churn by 43% with ChurnBlock"
- "Spotify increases conversion 25% using Amplitude analytics"
- "How a 50-person startup saved 1,200 hours annually with Notion"

> "Stories, especially relatable ones, can alter our brain chemistry. Speak to the emotion of your buyer persona using the problems or pain points they care about."
>
