○ [Option 2]

Great! Enter your email for early access:
[Email field]
```

## Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Too Much Information

Your page has one job: capture intent.

**Fix:** Remove navigation, limit text, single CTA.

### 2. No Social Proof

Empty pages feel risky.

**Fix:** Add signup count (even "Join 100+ others").

### 3. Vague Value Proposition

"Something amazing is coming" tells nothing.

**Fix:** Specific benefits + who it's for.

### 4. Broken Mobile Experience

83% of visitors are on mobile.

**Fix:** Test on real devices, not just emulators.

### 5. No Follow-Up

Capturing email but going silent kills momentum.

**Fix:** Automated welcome + regular updates.

### 6. No Referral Mechanism

Missing viral growth opportunity.

**Fix:** Add share buttons and referral rewards.
